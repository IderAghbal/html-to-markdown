# html2markdown - convert html to markdown [version 2.3.4-test]

Convert HTML to Markdown. Even works with entire websites!

## Basics

By default the "Commonmark" Plugin will be enabled. You can customize the options,
for example changing the appearance of bold with --opt-strong-delimiter="__"

Other Plugins can also be enabled. For example "GitHub Flavored Markdown" (GFM)
extends Commonmark with more features.


## Escaping

Some characters have a special meaning in markdown. The library escapes these â€” if necessary.
See the documentation for more info.


## Security

Once you convert this markdown *back* to HTML you need to be careful of malicious content. 
Use a HTML sanitizer before displaying the HTML in the browser!


## Examples

    echo "<strong>important</strong>" | html2markdown

    curl --no-progress-meter http://example.com | html2markdown


## Flags

    -v, --version
        show the version of html2markdown and exit

    --help


    --opt-strong-delimiter
        Make bold text. Should <strong> be indicated by two asterisks or two underscores?
        "**" or "__" (default: "**")

    --plugins
        which plugins should be enabled?
